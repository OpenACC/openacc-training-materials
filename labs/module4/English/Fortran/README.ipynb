However, we access `A` inside of our loop, and that loop is contained within a `parallel` region. Within that parallel region, `A(i)` is attempting to access a memory location within the GPU memory. We didn't explicitly allocate `A` on the GPU, so one of two things will happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The compiler will understand what we are trying to do, and automatically copy **A** from the CPU to the GPU.\n",

With the inclusion of the `copy` data clause, our program will now copy the content of `A` from the CPU memory, into GPU memory. Then, during the execution of the loop, it will properly access `A` from the GPU memory. After the parallel region is finished, our program will copy `A` from the GPU memory back to the CPU memory. Let's look at one more direct example.\n",

Array `A` will be allocated on the CPU, and then the first loop will execute. This loop will set the contents of `A` to be all 0. Then the second loop is encountered; the program will copy the array `A` (which is full of 0's) into GPU memory. Then, we will execute the second loop on the GPU. This will edit the GPU's copy of `A` to be full of 1's.\n",
