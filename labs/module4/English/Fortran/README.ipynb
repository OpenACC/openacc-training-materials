Within that parallel region, **A(i)** is attempting to access a memory location within the GPU memory. We didn't explicitly allocate **A** on the GPU, so one of two things will happen.\n",

After the parallel region is finished, our program will copy **A** from the GPU memory back to the CPU memory. Let's look at one more direct example.\n",

Array **A** will be allocated on the CPU, and then the first loop will execute. This loop will set the contents of **A** to be all 0. Then the second loop is encountered; the program will copy the array **A** (which is full of 0's) into GPU memory. Then, we will execute the second loop on the GPU. This will edit the GPU's copy of **A** to be full of 1's.\n",
