However, when looking at the **TOTAL** view, it was reporting that all of the threads combined were spending 45 seconds running calcNext. This means that each thread spent around 11 second running calcNext, and once you added them all together, it totaled to be 45 seconds. This **TOTAL** view does not take into consideration that all of these threads are running **simultaneously**. So, when you add up all of their times together, it is about 45 seconds.
