    "This is our last optimization, and arguably the most important one. In OpenACC, the concepts of *Gang*, *Worker*, and *Vector* are used to define additional levels of parallelism. Specifically for NVIDIA GPUs, gang worker vector will define the *organization* of our GPU threads (or sometimes referred to as the *decomposition* of or loop iterations). Each loop will have an optimal Gang Worker Vector implementation, and finding that correct implementation will often take a bit of thinking, and possibly some trial and error. So let's explain how Gang Worker Vector actually works.\n",

    "This image represents a single **gang**. When parallelizing our **for loops**, the **loop iterations** will be **broken up evenly** among a number of gangs. Each gang will contain a number of **threads**. These threads are organized into **blocks**. A **worker** is a row of threads. In the above graphic, there are 3 **workers**, which means that there are 3 rows of threads. The **vector** refers to how long each row is. So in the above graphic, the vector is 8, because each row is 8 threads long.\n",

There are many ways to alter and optimize our loops, though it is up to the programmer to decide which route is the best to take. At this point in the lab series, you should be able to begin parallelizing your own personal code, and to be able to achieve a relatively high performance using OpenACC."
