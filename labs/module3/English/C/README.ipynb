    "## OpenACC Directives\n",
    "\n",
    "Using OpenACC directives will allow us to parallelize our code without needing to explicitly alter our code. What this means is that, by using OpenACC directives, we can have a single code that will function as both a sequential code and a parallel code.\n",

    "\n",
    "**#pragma acc &lt;directive> &lt;clauses>**\n",
    "\n",
    "**#pragma** in C/C++ is what's known as a \"compiler hint.\" These are very similar to programmer comments, however, the compiler will actually read our pragmas. Pragmas are a way for the programmer to \"guide\" the compiler, without running the chance damaging the code. If the compiler does not understand the pragma, it can ignore it, rather than throw a syntax error.\n",
    "\n",
    "**acc** is an addition to our pragma. It specifies that this is an **OpenACC pragma**. Any non-OpenACC compiler will ignore this pragma. Even our PGI compiler can be told to ignore them. (which lets us run our parallel code sequentially!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**directives** are commands in OpenACC that will tell the compiler to do some action. For now, we will only use directives that allow the compiler to parallelize our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**clauses** are additions/alterations to our directives. These include (but are not limited to) optimizations. The way that I prefer to think about it: directives describe a general action for our compiler to do (such as, paralellize our code), and clauses allow the programmer to be more specific (such as, how we specifically want the code to be parallelized).\n"

    "\n",
    "The parallel directive may be the most straight-forward of the directives. It will mark a region of the code for parallelization (this usually only includes parallelizing a single **for** loop.) Let's take a look:\n",

    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We may also define a \"parallel region\". The parallel region may have multiple loops (though this is often not recommended!) The parallel region is everything contained within the outer-most curly braces.\n",

    "\n",
    "`#pragma acc parallel loop` will mark the next loop for parallelization. It is extremely important to include the **loop**, otherwise you will not be parallelizing the loop properly. The parallel directive tells the compiler to \"redundantly parallelize\" the code. The **loop** directive specifically tells the compiler that we want the loop parallelized. Let's look at an example of why the loop directive is so important.\n",

Recall that when using the `parallel` directive, it must always be paired with the `loop` directive, otherwise the code will be improperly parallelized. The `kernels` directive does not follow the same rule, and in some compilers, adding the loop directive may limit the compilers ability to optimize the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "As said previously, the `kernels` directive is the exact opposite of the `parallel` directive. This means that the compiler is making a lot of assumptions, and may even override the programmers decision to parallelize code. Also, by default, the compiler will attempt to optimize the loop. The compiler is generally pretty good at optimizing loops, and sometimes may be able to optimize the loop in a way that the programmer cannot describe. However, usually, the programmer will be able to achieve better performance by optimizing the loop themself.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run into a situation where the compiler refuses to parallelize a loop, you may override the compilers decision. (however, keep in mind that by overriding the compilers decision, you are taking responsibility for any mistakes the occur from parallelizing the code!) In this code segment, we are using the independent clause to ensure the compiler that we think the loop is parallelizable.\n",

Any mistakes made by the parallelization is at the fault of the programmer. It is recommended to use a parallel directive for each loop you want to parallelize.\n",

Some parallel hardware is simply limited in its parallel capability, and thus parallelizing inner loops does not offer any extra performance (though is also does not hurt the program, either.) In this lab, we are using a multicore CPU as our parallel hardware, and thus, multi-loop parallelization isn't entirely possible. However, when using GPUs (which we will in the next lab!) we can utilize multi-loop parallelism.\n",

    "3. As discussed earlier, a multicore accelerator is only able to take advantage of one level of parallelism. However, a GPU can take advantage of more. Make sure to use the skills you learned in the **Loop Directive** section of the lab, and parallelize the multi-dimensional loops in our code. Then run the script below to run the code on a GPU. Compare the results (including compiler feedback) to our multicore implementation."
