If the compiler does not understand `!$acc` it can ignore it, rather than throw a syntax error because it's just a comment.\n",

The compiler is generally pretty good at optimizing loops, and sometimes may be able to optimize the loop in a way that the programmer cannot describe. However, usually, the programmer will be able to achieve better performance by optimizing the loop themself.\n",

This is done by putting the statement \"!acc end kernels\" at the end of the directive region.\n",

    "3. As discussed earlier, a multicore accelerator is only able to take advantage of one level of parallelism. However, a GPU can take advantage of more. Make sure to use the skills you learned in the **Loop Directive** section of the lab, and parallelize the multi-dimensional loops in our code. Then run the script below to run the code on a GPU. Compare the results (including compiler feedback) to our multicore implementation."
