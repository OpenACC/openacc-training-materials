    "Relying on managed memory to handle data management can reduce the effort the programmer needs to parallelize their code, however, not all GPUs work with managed memory, and it is also lower performance than using explicit data management. OpenACC gives the programmer two main ways to handle data management, structured and unstructured data directives. By using these, the programmer is able to minimize the number of data transfers needed in their program."
